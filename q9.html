    <font color="red"><center><p>Do you have a handful of blogs that you follow purely for fun?</center></font>

        Over the past few years, I’ve moved away from following primarily recipe blogs to spending my time enjoying
        other types of lifestyle blogs, and it has been awesome. I
        admire, cool people working for social justice, interesting perspectives on faith, DIY stuff I actually want to
        try, you name it! Mostly they’re just blogs that have nothing to do with recipes, and I find that I look forward
        to reading them more than ever. But that said, the blogs in my reader that get the most clicks by a landslide
        are in my favorite category that I have oh-so-creatively named — get ready for it — “fun”.</p>

        <p>
        And they are just that — blogs I find fun! Some I have followed for years and years, some are pretty new to me.
        Some deal with 100% light and fluffy stuff, some dig a little deeper into the meat of life. Some of them share
        the most beautiful prose, some are random and chatty and full of incomplete sentences. 
        <br>But I love them all, and
        can genuinely say that I look forward to reading them most mornings (after I read The Skimm, of course, which
        I’m still obsessed with), and also genuinely admire each of the bloggers behind them. ♥
        <br><br>
        So if any of you are on the prowl for some new non-recipe blogs, I thought I’d share 7 of my favorites with you
        today. I’m guessing you’ll be familiar with a few, but I’m hoping there might be a few new gems in there for you
        to discover.
        <br> And hey — if you have some favorites of your own, pretty please share them in the comments below,
        because I totally want to check ’em out.

        Have “fun”!
